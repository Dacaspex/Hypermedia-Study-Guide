These projects can be research-oriented or design-oriented and are done in different research groups in the department. The exact contents of the projects is determined by the supervisor of the research group where the project is done, in consultation with the student. The expected outcome of the project is a paper (published as a technical report of the department, and possibly also elsewhere).</p>\n<pBeside the projects, the student participates in other activities of the research group (for example in research seminars) and is encouraged to participate in activities organized by one of the national Dutch research schools (ASCI, IPA, or SIKS). The latter activities are typically short courses or conferences. Students who successfully complete the Honors program will receive a certificate upon graduation.\nParticipating in the Honors program is especially useful if you are interested in taking a PhD later on, since it allows you to experience what it is like to do research in two different areas.

As final project supervisors can act assistant professors, associate professors and full professors from the Computer Science sub-department within the Mathematics and Computer Science department. If you are in doubt how to choose the graduation supervisor please consider contacting your mentor.</p>\n<p>The start of your master project is marked by submitting a completed graduation plan containing the necessary information on the project (name, place, period, supervisor, and so on), and stating the fact that you have completed your curricular part of the program.

In practice, however, it turns out to be rather difficult to plan all your curricular activities and, especially, their success. If all courses have been completed, permission to start the master project will be granted. If more than two courses or 10 credit points (whichever is lower) have not been completed, such permission will not be granted. In other cases (no more than two courses or 10 credit points not yet completed) it depends on the status of the uncompleted courses whether permission to start the master project will be granted, and if so, whether it is feasible to work on the project full time. Courses that are to be taken as homologation units must be completed and passed before you are allowed to start the master project. Also, be aware that you are not allowed to finish your project (with presentation and defense) before you have completed all your courses. So do not be too optimistic in doing courses and project together, because it may harm both.

Both of you are responsible for the progress, and the supervisor can be expected to give regular feedback. After one month, you should make sure to have a more clear schedule for structure, content, and phasing of the project. The project is concluded with a thesis and a presentation followed by a defense. The thesis should be handed in to assessment committee three weeks before the defense (although in practice, this period may be shorter). It is advisable to do a midterm presentation to show content and progress to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>In general, the master project should be completed within 6 months from the start. An extension to 9 months is possible. In exceptional cases, and only if it is clear that the project can be finished, the exam committee may allow for an additional 3 months period. It is important to note that the project must be finished within 1 year. A project not finished within 1 year is automatically cancelled and graded as "fail".

On the one hand, these technologies provide us with an ever-increasing range of opportunities, and are often a fascinating source of enjoyment and comfort. Yet, these new products and systems also become increasingly complex, may be difficult to operate, unsafe or annoying. People will never succeed in exploiting the full range offunctions afforded by these technologies, and often use them inefficiently and ineffectively. Consequently, they may get frustrated and their trust in these technologies may be eroded. It is also not entirely clear what are exactly people''s preferences regarding evolving new technologies.\nThe Master''s program Human-Technology Interaction offers a unique opportunity to study these issues by applying knowledge from the social sciences, in particular psychology, to problems raised by the introduction of new technologies. The program is based on three fundamentals:</p>\n<ul><li>human behaviour, specifically applied to technological settings</li>\n<li>user-oriented development of technological products and environments</li>\n<li>scientific methodology</li></ul>\n<h2>The HTI program</h2>\n<p>The program offers basic knowledge from psychology covering basic themes such as perception, cognition, language and communication, and attitudes and social cognition.

In particular, it is aimed at shedding light on questions like how should products, systems and environments be shaped such that they best serve the goals and needs of individual users, social groups and society in general, in a most efficient way, at the same time minimizing unwanted side effects. The technological domains on which the program focuses are the build environment, information and communication technology and sustainable energy.\nHuman-Technology Interaction masters acquire the knowledge and skills that should enable them to assess the feasibility of new technological developments in view of human values, goals, constraints and capabilities.

In all cases, a staff member of the HTI group will be supervising your project. In the graduation projects section, we present for each staff member their topics of interest and some examples from past projects they have supervised.</p>\n<h2>Who is coordinating the graduation projects?</h2>\n<p>Currently, Raymond Cuijpers is coordinating the graduation projects. When you start planning your project, you should consult him. He will be aware of projects that are open. Together with him, you can discuss what project would match your interests and who could be a suitable supervisor. Even if you already have a supervisor and a project, you should still visit Raymond Cuijpers. In this way we can keep track of all the ongoing projects. He can also tell you more about the procedures. The document attached below already provides some information on important issues regarding the HTI master project.</p>\n<h2>What facilities are provided for students who do their projects internally?</h2>\n<p>The HTI group has good facilities for students who do an internal graduation project. First, the HTI labs are available for research. Secondly, there are several office spaces available were several students can work on their projects. For more details about the facilities, contact the HTI secretary office.</p>\n<h2>Master Thesis</h2>\n<p>Here you can find the Master Thesis Manual for Human-Technology Interaction (HTI) and Innovation Sciences (IS) and the master thesis forms (see downloads).
